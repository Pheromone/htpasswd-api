# htpasswd-api

Small REST API made with Flask (python) to generate htpasswd files. The files can be used with nginx or apache.
Groups are currently not supported.

You can look into [vagrant-control](https://github.com/Pheromone/vagrant-control) if you need an interface.

# Note 

Keep in mind that this project is closer to ALPHA than to STABLE. DO NOT use on production system.
